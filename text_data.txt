The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The early bird catches the worm.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Actions speak louder than words.
